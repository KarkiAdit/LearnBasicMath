This repository solves elementary level Math problems covering topics like Algebra, Conversion, and Measures of Central Tendency. I have shared both the source file and executable file of the program. If you have problem downloading the files and running the .exe file, it may be due to your browser restricting to download accounting to the fact that the file comes from an unregistered author and there may be a virus threat. If so, force download while downloading and do run anyway while opening the .exe file. Else, download an IDE (QB64 of Microsoft will be ideal) and just open the .bas file using it and then run the file. Here's the official link for QB64 download from Microsoft: https://www.qb64.org/portal/.

The main program (BASIC MATH TOOL.exe) consists of 5 different Mathematical operations options:

1.	Function: Consists of domain and range finding algorithms for linear algebraic-functions

2.	Equations: Consists of factorization algorithms for finding the roots of quadratic equations and common-solution-algorithms for two simultaneous linear equations

3.	Conversion: Consists of hr:min:sec conversion algorithms for any given time, km:meter:cm conversion algorithms for any given distance, and currency conversion algorithms

4.	 Sequence & Series: Consists of common difference, common ratio and nth term finding algorithms for any given Arithmetic progression and Geometric Progression

5.	Arithmetic Mean: Consists of arithmetic mean finding algorithms for given individual, discrete, and continuous series
